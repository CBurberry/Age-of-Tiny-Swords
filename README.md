## GameDev.tv 2025 Entry - 'Age of Tiny Swords'

A bite-sized experience for RTS fans. It's a formula that needs very little explanation, defeat all the goblins to win. There is only one map but it is somewhat large.

Houses can produce more villagers by clicking on them and selecting the unit. Castles can train Knights and and Archers. Towers are a good defensive option too.

I'll try and address any balancing issues in a future update but I hope you have fun.

Due to pathfinding constraints, new building placement can only be done on the blue zones. Click the '+' sign to bring up a building menu. Select the building you want and voila! (you have to tell a pawn to go build it!)

Note: Press the Home button in the top-left if you get lost in the fog of war, it will re-center your view.

WebGL is less performant than Windows so if you're finding that the FPS is too low in the WebGL build, please download the Windows build below.

Controls
Left-click to select a unit
Right-click to make a selected unit interact with something
Mouse Wheel scroll for zoom (or use left shift/left ctrl buttons on WebGL)

Made for GameDev.Tv 2025 Game Jam over a 10 day period between a team of two.
